# Eww, Rain

Informational [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) widgets to work in conjunction with KDE Plasma.

[![Screenshot of the KDE Plasma panel, with Eww “windows” on top. There are widgets for drives, "days until" thingy, weather, clock on the left. On the right, network up/down, CPU load and temp, GPU load and temp, regular and video memory. In the middle are the KDE Plasma Task Manager and the System Tray.](eww-rain.png "Eww Rain")](eww-rain.png)

Somewhat documented. A couple of points:

- [Official documentation](https://elkowar.github.io/eww/eww.html);
- `widgets.wallet.yuck` links to not included files for obvious reasons;
- [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) scripts would be identical to bash scripts (or any other, I guess), it’s just what I use;
- I still use KDE Plasma Task Manager and System Tray;
- I don’t use the built-in variables for disk space and network speed, I find them inaccurate.
